<h1 style="text-align: center;">Thank you for your interest in Clever Cloud!</h1>

At Clever Cloud, we want to rethink what a Cloud Service Provider should be for businesses and developers around the world. We deal with complexity so that our customers don’t have to. Our mission is simple: Build a powerful, versatile yet simple to use, Cloud Platform.

**We are looking for engineers who share our mission.**

<br/>

Our most deeply held engineering belief is in the deep understanding of technology. Mastering a domain area can be a life challenge, and there isn’t always a clear path to solve a problem. As if that weren’t enough, we believe that true magic happens when hardware and software are designed to work with one another. Generally speaking, deep understanding is key for good engineering designs.

**We are looking for engineers who like to solve hard problems.**

<br/>

At Clever Cloud, we have simple values we think are important to work together. Differences between people are the driver to an open mindset which turns to be key to engineering: surpass our own belief, understand alternative ways of thinking or rethink the status quo.

**We are looking for engineers who share our values.**

<br/>

We believe that the best basis for assessment of an engineer is not through their performance on an arbitrary oral exam, but rather through their own expression.  That’s why we use interviews to deeply understand the complete engineer who your work indicates you to be. 

You should find that these candidate materials will take no more than a couple of hours to gather; please fork or clone this document, and for each section, please use the space you need, expanding into additional pages as necessary. When completed, please export this document as a PDF and submit it with your application at jobs _AT_ clever-cloud.com. Note we mostly use english for written work, unless it's a real issue for you, please use english to answer.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Questionnaire</h2>


Please answer the following questions, using as much space as you need. All of these questions are important, but the final question is probably the most important one; take your time in answering it!

<strong>_What work have you found most technically challenging in your career and why?_</strong>

That time when i had to make a real working ubereat clone serving 3 big cities and their suburbs.
It took lots of realtime logistics&communication software/interfaces development, closely knitting several different actors together: 
-the customers
-the restaurants lobbies, and their kitchens
-the deliverers,
-the on-call dispatchers
-the platform owners

It also took a good deal of dedicated hardware management as well, online and at edge infra servers, tablets, printer and handheld devices)

<strong>_What work have you done that you were particularly proud of and why?_</strong>

The one i would be particularly proud of would be the iot api platform i did to spice up a boring old fashioned tech : thermal printers. The design i figured out is delightfully simple, yet required indepth technical comprehension of an old proprietary language (ESC/POS) and marrying it to modern web/api and realtime tech. The result is fullfilling : a fleet of as many standalone printers you wish, and remotely printing on any or all of them with simple api request

<strong>_When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?_</strong>

I don't have a specific happiest moment in my pro career, i have had many, but 2 periods more than others come to mind:

Early in my career when on my first 360° "webmaster" job in 2005-6, but it was more of a CTO/COO position in the end. 
I got to get actively involved, and in minute details, in each and every part of the business i worked for, digitizing every single part of it, from coding and setting up it's first dedicated server and online store to pluggin'it to the newly digitized finance backend i coded too, to rolling out digital logistic tools to setting up and managing marketing campains to interconnecting marketplaces thought api's etc etc.. Witnessing the direct relation between each incremental improvements and the sales performances go up months after months on good old google analytics was exhilarating
 
And then more recenty in my career, within my own company, with a set of api tools i set up and provided to professionals.
For the freedom of exploring technical and business opportunities as they come, and for the greatest pleasure of seeing my customers using my products and enjoying seeing them satisfied     

<strong>_When have you been unhappiest in your professional career and why?_</strong>

When Covid brought to a halt the expansions of my last project

<strong>_Regarding CleverCloud's values, is there any that you oppose?_</strong>

I can't see why i would oppose any of them. Rather, i would say a good balance is enviable, not too much, not too little

<strong>_For a pair of CleverCloud's values, describe a time in which the two values came into tension for you or your work, and how you resolved it._</strong>

In my experience, tension between Urgency and Thriftiness are a recurring situation in most projects. Without recalling one specifically in details (truely way too many), it usually goes like this: you start development with a fixed budget and a tight deadline, for say.. a live video streaming platform. Suddenly you find out the deadline is too tight and that a critical component of the project you wanted to do inhouse will take much more time than expected, and that a relatively expensive proprietary software and license is already available but would significantly accelerate the development process, allowing you to meet the client's tight deadline. The over-cost is a significant portion of the project budget, and there is a concern about exceeding the initially allocated funds.

After evaluating pro and cons, you ultimately decide to invest in the proprietary software, choosing the shortest licence term possible, as the time saved ensures that you deliver the project on time and meet the client's expectations. However, parallely, you also implement cost-saving measures in other areas of the project to mitigate the initial budget impact (servers specs, bandwidth..). Then you finish coding that critical component inhouse, and you phase out the proprietary software later, replacing it with yours. The next year and the followings, you fall again within the projected overall budget you agreed on with your client 


<strong>_What do you think should be improved on our product?_</strong>

I am not really in a position to give any advice, but as for any other tech company offering public services, documentation is always perfectible, for sure :) . 

Other than that, it is really too early, i don't have any practice using Clever cloud's products, but looking at the documentation, i can see "Develop" and "Deploy" are the main sections .. how about an "Observe" section ? also, what about secrets management :)

<strong>_Why do you want to work for CleverCloud?_</strong>

Work in a modern, agile environment, in a position and a domain involving communicating with humans, coding/scripting/configuring & running up software and infrastructure 

Get exposed to lots of different customer technical levels and needs and get to know, help and accompagny these customers in achieving their goals.

Last but not least, further expand my technical knowledge in fast-paced domains

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Work samples</h2>

<br/>

The ultimate measure of an engineer is our work. Please submit between one to three work samples, providing links if/as necessary. This should be work that best reflects you as an engineer -- work that you are proud of or you feel is otherwise representative of who you aspire to be as an engineer. If this work is entirely proprietary, please describe it as fully as you can, providing necessary context.

<ins>Writing samples</ins>

We have found that the engineers that we like to work with tend to value the written word. What’s an example of writing that you are proud of?  This writing can take a variety of forms, e.g.: \




* A block comment in source code
* A blog entry or other long-form post on a technical issue
* A technical architecture document, design document, specification, whitepaper or academic paper

Please submit at least one writing sample (and no more than three) that you feel represents you, providing links if/as necessary.

<ins>Analysis samples</ins>

A significant challenge of engineering is dealing with a system when it doesn't, in fact, work correctly.  When systems misbehave, engineers must flip their disposition:  instead of a creator of their own heaven and earth, they must become a scientist, attempting to reason about a foreign world. Please provide an analysis sample: a written analysis of system misbehavior from some point in your career. If such an analysis is not readily available (as it might not be if one’s work has been strictly proprietary), please recount an incident in which you analyzed system misbehavior, including as much technical detail as you can recall.

<ins>Presentation samples</ins>

Especially as engineers become more senior, oral presentation of work becomes an important vehicle for communication. If you have given a technical presentation that is publicly available, please provide a link to the slides (and the video if available).  Engineers are often also very self-conscious about their presentations, so don’t worry about any imperfections — and don’t be concerned if it’s brief or informal! If you don’t have a publicly available presentation, please describe a topic on which you have presented in the past.

I have never presented anything publicly, as i never needed to :/
